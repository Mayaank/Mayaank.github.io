Number of unlikely events, would increase if we keep on increasing the domain where they would be 
occuring. Earlier, before the advent of radio, when we didn't have much visibility into what was 
happening in the other part of the city (Don't even bother about what was happening in other parts
of the world), we were least bothered and were much more happy ( I guess)

But now, when we have the "news" from all over the world, at our fingertips, we are constantly
bombarded with new information, which might not have any direct or indirect effect on us. 

We see more of the bad stuff now, then we used to see before. That makes the world a much more 
ugly place to live in.

It's simple math. At any given moment, there are zillion things which can go wrong and has the 
potential to create havoc. And we are going to hear about it.

And thus the number of unlikely events, in our knowledge, would also increase.
