## What is it? 
A conceptual framework that represents the journey a potential customer takes from being aware of the product/service to making a purchase.
The "funnel" signifies, implicitly, that not everyone aware of your business is going to buy from you.
Hence, it's wider at the top and narrower at the bottom.

## How is it useful? 
Besides providing an intuitive visualisation of the journey of a (potential) customer, one can also identify the areas which are lacking and can work on improving them. With insights gained from the sales funnel, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, messaging, and sales processes to improve conversion rates at each step. 
As the saying goes -- "What you can't measure, you can't improve.", so this framework helps you put numbers into perspective. And if you are tracking these numbers closely, it can help you make forecasts and create strategies based on them. 

## Steps of sales funnel
As this is only a framework, different industries can tweak it according to their own needs. But in general, we can break down the funnel into 4 steps:

### 1. Increasing Awareness (Marketing)
If your potential customers are not even aware of your product/service, then you are in deep trouble. 
Let's say you are running an e-commerce business, then you can create awareness about your product via digital marketing campaigns:
- SEO
- Content Marketing
- Digital Advertising


### 2. Engaging with the product/service
This step would rely on building credibility and trust with the potential customers. Businesses focus on generating a positive emotional trigger to influence people to make purchases. At this point, leads would show interest in what you offer, so you should have a strategy in place to influence leads to make your product/service look trustworthy and credible.

They would also be evaluating their options, and comparing your offerings with competitors, reading reviews, and seeking more information to make an informed decision.

It can be done using: 
- Good landing page
- Videos 
- Blogs 
- Social Media presence
- Newsletters

### 3. Making Purchase
Once your leads are converted to prospects, they have a strong intention to purchase. They would be showing buying signals, like subscribing to the newsletter or on social media, requesting demos, using free-trials, etc. 
At this stage, the focus should be to convert these prospects into customers, using email marketing, retargeting ads, and on-call conversations.
Providing incentives.

### 4. Customer Retention
Once the prospect has become the customer, you will need to focus on making their experience so good that they would market your product/service using word-of-mouth. 

## In conclusion: 
If the sales funnel is properly implemented (with automation) and monitored, it can serve as a predictable sales engine that can grow your business.
Businesses should closely monitor key metrics such as conversion rates (at each stage), customer acquisition cost, and lifetime value to identify areas of improvement and optimization. Also with time, businesses would need to experiment with different strategies within the funnel and use A/B testing to identify what works best for the customers.
